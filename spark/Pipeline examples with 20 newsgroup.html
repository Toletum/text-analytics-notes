It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.  > However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual.  >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */ >           8,                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput,          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */ >           CWColormap, >           &attr >         );  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse      mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu ","comp.windows.x",0.0],["58970","From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Subject: Re: ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION FACT SHEET Reply-To: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Organization: Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer Science Lines: 26  In article <1993Apr13.150018.641@lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com> dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com writes:  >My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region >in the past three years.

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the  same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system,  and the numbers ended up closer.

The \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ","soc.religion.christian",0.0],["58953","From: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Subject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator: robin@volans Nntp-Posting-Host: volans Reply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Organization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA Distribution: na Lines: 141  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about  1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse      mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu ","comp.windows.x",0.0,["From:","mouse@thunder.mcrcim.mcgill.edu","(der","Mouse)","Subject:","Re:","Creating","8","bit","windows","on","24","bit","display..","How?","Organization:","McGill","Research","Centre","for","Intelligent","Machines","Lines:","59","In","article","<1993Apr16.093209.25719@fwi.uva.nl>,","stolk@fwi.uva.nl","(Bram)","writes:",">","I","am","using","an","X","server","that","provides","3","visuals:","PseudoColor","8","bit,",">","Truecolor","24","bit","and","DirectColor","24","bit.","Lucky","dog...",":-)",">","A","problem","occurs","when","I","try","to","create","a","window","with","a","visual","that","is",">","different","from","the","visual","of","the","parent","(which","uses","the","default",">","visual","which","is","TC24).",">","In","the","Xlib","reference","guide","from","'O","reilly","one","can","read","in","the",">","section","about","XCteateWindow,","something","like:",">","In","the","current","implementation","of","X11:","When","using","a","visual","other",">","than","the","parent's,","be","sure","to","create","or","find","a","suitable","colourmap",">","which","is","to","be","used","in","the","window","attributes","when","creating,","or",">","else","a","BadMatch","occurs.",">","This","warning,","strangely","enough,","is","only","mentioned","in","the","newer",">","editions","of","the","X11R5","guides.","It","applies","with","equal","force","to","earlier","versions.","Presumably","only","recently","did","the","author(s)","decide","it","was","important","enough","to","mention.","The","necessity","it","refers","to","has","always","been","there,","but","it's","been","implicit","in","the","way","CreateWindow","requests","default","some","attributes","of","the","new","window.",">","However,","even","if","I","pass","along","a","suitable","colourmap,","I","still","get","a",">","BadMatch","when","I","create","a","window","with","a","non-default","visual.",">","attr.colormap","=","cmap;",">","win","=","XCreateWindow(","[...]",">","CopyFromParent,","/*","border","width","*/",">","8,","/*","depth","*/",">","InputOutput,","/*","class","*/",">","vinfo.visual,","/*","visual","*/",">","CWColormap,",">","&attr",">",");","This","is","because","the","warning","you","read","is","incomplete.","You","have","to","provide","not","only","a","colormap","but","also","a","border.","The","default","border","is","CopyFromParent,","which","is","not","valid","when","the","window's","depth","doesn't","match","its","parent's.","Specify","a","border-pixmap","of","the","correct","depth,","or","a","border-pixel,","and","the","problem","should","go","away.","There","is","another","problem:","I","can't","find","anything","to","indicate","that","CopyFromParent","makes","any","sense","as","the","border_width","parameter","to","XCreateWindow.","Your","Xlib","implementation","probably","defines","CopyFromParent","as","zero,","to","simplify","the","conversion","to","wire","format,","so","you","are","unwittingly","asking","for","a","border","width","of","zero,","due","to","the","Xlib","implementation","not","providing","stricter","type-checking.","(To","be","fair,","I'm","not","entirely","certain","it's","possible","for","Xlib","to","catch","this.)","der","Mouse","mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"]],["58970","From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Subject: Re: ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION FACT SHEET Reply-To: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Organization: Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer Science Lines: 26  In article <1993Apr13.150018.641@lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com> dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com writes:  >My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region >in the past three years.

The \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --

robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Subject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator: robin@volans Nntp-Posting-Host: volans Reply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Organization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA Distribution: na Lines: 141  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about  1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story.

The Twincom internal version has a 550A and one of the Rockwell chips is marked RC144DP.  But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware problems.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.  > However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual.  >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */ >           8,                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput,          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */ >           CWColormap, >           &attr >         );  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the  same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system,  and the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their helicopters, rolling dice.  I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and  basing their count on those.

jwindley@cheap.cs.utah.edu (Jay Windley) Subject: Mormon temples Organization: University of Utah CS Dept Lines: 113  mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server) writes: | One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the | temple rituals secret.  The \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --

robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Subject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator: robin@volans Nntp-Posting-Host: volans Reply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Organization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA Distribution: na Lines: 141  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about  1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Parr) writes: }Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human, }we have *all* the advantages.  I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama, it will just hop on and insist on a ride.

I have just bought a Twincom 14.4DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset.
