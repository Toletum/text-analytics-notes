I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma). Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never  state why faith and dogma are dangerous.    If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in Waco, you are missing the point.    The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed everything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the  followers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their parents).  >I have expressed this notion in the past.  Some Christians debated >with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning.  I claimed >rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma.  So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at, but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.   >A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind, >whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present >in any religion.  Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?     >I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian, >but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those >of Christianity. Consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison >is not a prisoner, unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone >in a prison. >Can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison? >Can we define a Christian to be someone who at the moment has Christian >beliefs?  No, because if a person is free to go, he is not a prisoner. >Similarly, if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma, he is not >a Christian.  So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however, you can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The two are not compatible.   >Religion is like the gun that doesn't kill anybody.  Religion encourages >faith and dogma and although it doesn't directly condemn people, >it encourages the use of ``just because'' thinking.  It is >``just because'' thinking that kills people.  I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^) Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn groups of people.  The common target is the \"infidel,\" a curious being who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)  Please explain how \"just because\" thinking kills people.  (And please state more in your answer than \"Waco.\")   >Of course, not all humans are capable of thought, and we'd still >have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide...but not as much. >I'm willing to bet on that.  I'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious  zealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide was a problem.  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents.   Mass suicides are far from common.  --  ---                      __  _______                              --- ||| Kevin Marshall       \\ \\/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech

Summary: 10Mpixel/sec Winmark 3.11 at 800x600 256 colours Keywords: winmark, accelerator, chip, Hint Article-I.D.: shelley.1r9r5rINNps6 Distribution: world Organization: University of Washington, Seattle Lines: 43 NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu  I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.  It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.  Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets.  Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.  Using ET4000/W32 drivers 640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.         32k        7.34          64k        7.30 800x600 256       10.07         32k        6.38         64k        6.35 1kx786  256        8.17  Using ET4000 drivers. 640x480 16M        1.78 800x600  16colours 4.01      1kx786   16        4.22  From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.  The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer. It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution.  From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card in 256 colours mode.

Another guy here was  using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the  default VGA for Windows).  He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I  loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.   Seems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4  that would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the  keyboard instead sometimes!

theo@walt.caps.maine.edu (Theo M. Alpert) Subject: Data Paging Info WANTED Organization: UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway Lines: 19 NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu           Hello, I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers  and *how* the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how  I would go about building a device to decode the paging data  (like my pager does) and feed it though an RS232 port.     I'm planning on seperating different paging messages and  different pagers in software to keep amount of hardware I need  down....  Does anyone know what chips (Motorola?) are good for  decoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing it down an RS232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ?      (I already have a radio reciever with headphone level  output for the audio signal from the paging tower, but I'd be  interested in anything you know about pagers, including the  type of radio recievers they use!)

That particular FAQ (I've forgotten the author) discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support.  Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic?  BTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely.  One of the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a  MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of  Synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which  covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a  pro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated. [This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.]      Tim  [I think it's time for me to post the FAQ.    This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other side, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an \"evangelist\".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do not appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the General Assembly next month.  If the church can't come up with a solution that will let people live with each other, I think we're end up with a split.

I _do_ know that BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments give accuracies on the order of \"fractions of a degree\", if that's  any help.  Speaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps for orbit adjust appear to be going well.  Our branch guy who's helping out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the burns will take place in mid-June.  Anyway, I'm off to find out more.
