# Document analysis 

Es index documents automatically and efficiently

Es supports database queries (SQL selection ) + full text queries + aggregation although a different type

In databases you define the datatypes in the physycal schema - data types and constraints => CREATE TABLE

In search engines, datatypes are defined in schemas  => schema.xml 
Besides ES, do not require schema definition, it can infer schema => Good for development
However, it is adviable to define schemas for search performance
